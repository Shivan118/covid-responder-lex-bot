## Flask
Flask is a micro framework provided for building light weight APIs and web apps or web sites. 

## Heroku
Heroku is Platform as a Service(PaaS) provider to host your websites. It provides certain amount of spaces free for hobyst to experiment and host their websites or webapps.

## APIs
APIs stands for Application Process Interface. These are nothing but URLs which when generally hit with POST request they return some data.

For example in our case I'm using 2 APIs to get Covid State and district wise data plus world wise data.

## MongoDb

Mongo db is a NoSQL database. I've used this database because of unstructured nature of our data gathering mainly for training our bot to get better accuracy.

Here I've used [cloud mongoDb](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) to store my data on mongo db cloud

## Web scrapping
This is a most important tool used to gather information which are not readily availble. We generailly used beautiful soup to go to a site and extact information from that.

In this project I have used Web scrapping to extract PIN code data from the website.
